## Task Completion Rule
CRITICAL: When any task is completed, update todo.md with:
- [x] Task description (file:line reference)
- Add any new pending tasks as [ ] items

## Project Context
- Hierarchical Deterministic Transport Solver for proton therapy
- Target hardware: RTX 2080 (8GB VRAM)
- Main language: CUDA C++
- Spec version: v0.8

## Key Physics Constraints
- R-based step control (NO S(E) usage - IC-1)
- Variance-based MCS accumulation (IC-2)
- Bin-edge energy discretization (IC-3)
- Energy conservation <1e-5, weight conservation <1e-6
