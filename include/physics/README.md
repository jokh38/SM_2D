# Physics Models

This directory contains header files for the physics models used in the solver.

## Components
- CSDA range lookup: lookup_R(E)
- Inverse energy lookup: lookup_E_inverse(R)
- R-based step size control (IC-1)
- Highland sigma computation
- Variance-based MCS accumulation (IC-2)
- Nuclear cross-section Sigma_total(E)
- 7-point angular quadrature weights

## Files
- (To be created in Phase 3)
